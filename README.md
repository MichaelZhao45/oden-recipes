# oden-recipes

Start of Project - July 7, 2023

This is the first project of the Odin Project on html, css and java script.  The website will be a basic site that will display recipes.
Once this project is done, I will have basic html skills and will be able to create a site with html.

End of Project - July 8, 2023

This project gave me a great foundation in basic html for web development.  
Further to that, will be a crucial skill in learning more about web dev and the skills required to create an excellent website.
