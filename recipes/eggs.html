    <h1> Hard-Boiled Eggs</h1>
    <img src="../images/egg.jpg" width="400" height="400">
    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. While you do not taste the vinegar or salt, they both pull the skin from the eggshell so it peels easily without tearing or sticking. 
        I have been making them this way for years. Family members call them "Ken's Eggs."</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 tablespoon salt </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar </li>
        <li> 6 cups of water </li>
        <li> 8 large eggs </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol> 
        <li> Gather all ingredients </li>
        <li> Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. </li>
        <li> Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes. </li>
        <li> Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a container of ice water or cold, running water. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week. </li>
        <li> Enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
